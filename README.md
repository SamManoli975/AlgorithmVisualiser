# index.html
this is the main page and it is a one page project, this page includes the buttons to activate the sorting algorithms, and the colored rectangular divs that changed based on the sorting algorithm, i also have a slider that changes the size of the array and then another slider to change the speed of the array.

# index.js
this file includes a function to create a random array, a function to update the array when the size is changed, a function to create the speed of the algorithm, and then a function to disable the buttons while the algorithms are ongoing and then also enable the buttons when when the algorithm is finished, the main function to run the functions that uses a switch statement to find the button that was pressed and run the corresponding function.

# algorithms
Bubble sort - checks the first 2 numbers, if the first is greater than the second then swap them around, move index by one and repeat the same thing, once you get to the end go back to the start of the list, repeat until solved
